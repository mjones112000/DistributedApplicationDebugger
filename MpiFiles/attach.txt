http://askubuntu.com/questions/41629/after-upgrade-gdb-wont-attach-to-process



In Maverick Meerkat (10.10) Ubuntu introduced a patch to disallow ptracing of non-child processes by non-root users - ie. only a process which is a parent of another process can ptrace it for normal users - whilst root can still ptrace every process. Hence why you can use gdb to attach via sudo still.

You can temporarily disable this restriction (and revert to the old behaviour allowing your user to ptrace (gdb) any of their other processes) by doing:

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
To permanently allow it edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change the line:

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1
To read

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
For some background on why this change was made, see the Ubuntu wiki
